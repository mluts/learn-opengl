# Timed Color Triangle

Triangle changes it's color with time. Setting color for fragment shader through
uniform variable, it is very handy. The color is defined on each cycle of a main
loop.

Currently i poorly understand how should look `(sin(time) / 2) + 0.5` if it's
a "G" (Green) in "RGB" and why author if this function decided so.

## C++
What i've learned here:
 * How to write a simple C++ class.
 * Discovered what happens when having a `std::string`, and returning `.c_str()`
   from scope where `std::string` was defined (valgrind shows that it is an
   error)
 * How to read from file and handle `std::ifstream` exceptions.

## OpenGL
 * Written my first C++ class for handling shaders.

As i understand, shaders are simple and focused programs running directly on GPU
designed for maximum customization of picture.
